# Team-profile-generator
In this project we will create a team profile generator thru node.
It is an application to help managers choose new employees for the company. We will use a command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Afterwards the application will be tested.
